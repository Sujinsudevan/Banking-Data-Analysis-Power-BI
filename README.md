# Banking Data Analysis

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes banking customer behavior and financial transactions using two integrated datasets—Banking Transactions and Customer Account Details—within Power BI to deliver actionable insights for risk management and customer profiling.

## Objectives  
- Understand transaction patterns by type and time  
- Analyze account balances, credit scores, and loan distributions  
- Identify risk factors and profitable customer segments  
- Build an interactive dashboard for decision-makers  

## Tools & Techniques  
- Power BI for dashboarding and DAX calculations  
- Power Query for data cleaning and modeling  
- Star schema data modeling to relate transactions with accounts  
- DAX measures for KPIs like total transactions, average balance, and risk flags  

## Key Insights  
- Peak transaction activity occurs between 10 AM and 3 PM, mainly in urban branches  
- Checking and loan accounts dominate balances; credit accounts have higher balances  
- Low credit scores correlate with higher loan amounts, indicating risk  
- Top 10% of loan borrowers hold 60% of total loans  
- Urban branches drive over 70% of transaction volume
